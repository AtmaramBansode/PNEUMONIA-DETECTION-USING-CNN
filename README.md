# PNEUMONIA-DETECTION-USING-CNN

PROBLEM Statment: IDENTIFY WHETHER The X RAY IMAGE OF CHEST IS NORMAL OR IS OF PNEUMONIC NATURE
Accuracy on the testing set: 64.0
The accuracy of the model on the test dataset is 64.0%. This means that the model correctly predicted the class of approximately 64.0% of the samples in the test dataset.


Our model is performing well but as per losses and accuracy curve per iterations. It is overfitting. This may be due to the unbalanced dataset. By balancing the dataset with an equal number of normal and pneumonia images. We can get a better result.
